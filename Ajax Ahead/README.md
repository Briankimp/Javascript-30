Ajax type ahead has been a great ride.

I have learnt about Regular Expresions
I am now able to use fetch function to access and manipulate data
I have learnt to puch array elemts into the major array effectively thtough push 
I have beena ble to appl some funcitions such as map() and filter() and I am now a notch better at using both of them.

I have also aplied some knowledge on events and event listeners and I am up to sepped with a couple of events.
