Ajax type ahead has been a great ride.

I have learnt about Regular Expresions
I am now able to use fetch function to access and manipulate data
I have learnt to push array elements into the major array effectively through push 
I have been able to apply some funcitions such as map() and filter() and I am now a notch better at using both of them.

I have also aplied some knowledge on events and event listeners and I am now UP TO SPEED with a couple of events.
