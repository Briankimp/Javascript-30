It's been quite a ride.
I have learnt about sort, map, reduce and filter functions.

I am now able to filter and sort elements in an array.
I am able to apply the map and reduce functions t iterate throught the array and manipulate elements.
With map for instance I am able to run throught the array easily transforming each item and returning a new array with the newly transformed elements.
with the reduce function I am able to run through an array and combine them into a single value for example adding a string of numbers.


in addition i have lrearnt a  couple of other principles of programing and some key take aways.
 making code readable and simple for reading.
 transforming nodelist to array;
 using shorter version of code e.g  if else code in sorting.

 I am able to get contents from a website and work with it on the console.
