From the Array Cardio Day 2. I have learnt ;

using three functions;
    .some()
    Every()
    find()
    findIndex()
    splice()

 Some() checks is at least one thing in the array meets what you are looking for;

 every() checks if all the items on the array meets what we are looking for.

 find() checks trhe array  to return an first item that matches a specific criteria

 findIndex() checks the particular position of the array element in the array



 I have learnt how to implicitly return using arrow function.

 I have learnt how to delete items on the array using he splice() finction.
