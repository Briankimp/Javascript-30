# Key Sequence Detection (Konami Codenpm)

This is a simple program that enables activates a fancy display feature w in cornify Js, once the user types the keysequence of ours

## Lessons Learnt

I have learnt basic array operarions such as 
    -push() - used to push items to an array
    -splice() - used to adjust the length of the array to ensure the most recent keys stay on the array
    -join() converts the array of keys into a single string
I have learnt event listening and handling for example;   " window.addEventListener('keyup', (e) => {})"
I have leanrt how to call external functions as well

## Usage

Run the code, 
Type 'brian' on the keyboard
Cornify Js runs on screen displaying some unicorn pictures
