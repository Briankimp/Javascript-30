# Stripe Follow ALong Dropdown

This code demonstrates a  dropdown background that follows along the dropdown menus and resizes itself to fit the content.

## Lesson Learnt.

 I have understood some DOM manipulations
 element.Queryselector(), ELement.getBoundingClientRect()" to get where exactly the particular element is at, among a few others which I hav used for a couple of times.

 I have grasped some CSS Manipulation concepts such addign and removing classes, setting css properties and checking if an element consists a particular css class.

  I have  kearnt to use conditional Logic.
  I have learnt to use objects to store mulriple related values, Looking to sharpen this as I revise.
  

  ## How To implement

Run the code and hover over the nav links
    The dropdown displays and follows allong as you hover the other links.
