I implemented transfroming nodelist into arrays using Array.from()
reduce  accumulates values across an array.
I have reinforced my knowledge on using the reduce functions.
I have learnt the importance of using data-sets to associates html elements with data
the logic of converting the seconds to hours then to minnutes was a good one.
I hope to experiment more with this one.
